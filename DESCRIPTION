Description: the library allows to perform a multivariate time series
            classification based on the use of DWT for feature extraction,
            a stepwise discriminant to select the most relevant features and
            finally, the use of a linear or quadratic discriminant for 
            classification. Note that all these steps can be done separately
            which allows to implement new steps.
