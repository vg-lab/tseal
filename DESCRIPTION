Description: The library allows to perform a multivariate time series
    classification based on the use of DWT for feature extraction, a
    stepwise discriminant to select the most relevant features and
    finally, the use of a linear or quadratic discriminant for
    classification. Note that all these steps can be done separately which
    allows to implement new steps.
